# Boss Ability System

## Overview

The Boss Ability System in BloodyBoss is a revolutionary feature that allows you to create unique boss encounters by mixing and matching abilities from different VBloods. Imagine taking the frost attacks from Vincent the Frostbringer and combining them with the whirlwind attacks from Gorecrusher - all while keeping your boss's original appearance!

## Understanding the Ability System

### The Concept

In vanilla V Rising, each VBlood has a fixed set of abilities that define how they fight. The Ability System breaks this limitation by allowing you to:

- **Keep the Look**: Your boss maintains its original model and appearance
- **Change the Fight**: Replace any or all abilities with those from other VBloods
- **Create Unique Encounters**: Mix abilities that were never meant to be together

### Real-World Example

Let's say you create a boss using the Alpha Wolf model:
- **Normally**: It would howl, bite, and summon wolf packs
- **With Ability System**: It could shoot holy projectiles like Solarus, teleport like Styx, and create frost explosions like Vincent
- **Result**: A wolf that fights like a magical hybrid - completely unexpected!

## How It Works

### The Slot System

Each boss has numbered ability slots (0 through 36+):
- **Slots 0-2**: Usually basic attacks and movement
- **Slots 3-6**: Primary combat abilities
- **Slots 7+**: Special abilities, ultimates, and passives

### The Process

1. **Choose a Boss Model**: This determines appearance only
2. **Browse Available Abilities**: See what each VBlood offers
3. **Test Compatibility**: Some combinations work better than others
4. **Apply Abilities**: Assign specific abilities to specific slots
5. **Test and Refine**: Make sure the combination is fun and balanced

## Getting Started

### Step 1: View Available VBloods

First, see what VBloods you can borrow abilities from:

```bash
.bb ability-list
```

This shows all 92 VBloods available. You can filter the list:

```bash
.bb ability-list wolf     # Shows all wolf-type VBloods
.bb ability-list frost    # Shows frost-themed VBloods
.bb ability-list vampire  # Shows vampire VBloods
```

### Step 2: Examine Specific Abilities

Once you find an interesting VBlood, examine their abilities:

```bash
.bb ability-info "Vincent the Frostbringer"
```

This shows you:
- What abilities Vincent has
- Which slots they occupy
- Cast times and cooldowns
- Special properties

### Step 3: Apply an Ability

To give your boss one of Vincent's abilities:

```bash
.bb ability-slot "Your Boss Name" "Vincent" 0 true "Frost projectile attack"
```

This command:
- Takes Vincent's slot 0 ability (his frost projectile)
- Gives it to your boss in their slot 0
- The description helps you remember what you configured

## Compatibility Guide

### Compatibility Levels

When you test or apply abilities, you'll see compatibility ratings:

#### [PERFECT] - Ideal Match
- No issues expected
- Animations align perfectly
- Highly recommended

#### [GOOD] - Works Well
- Minor visual quirks possible
- Fully functional
- Safe to use

#### [WARNING] - Use with Caution
- Visual glitches likely
- May look strange but works
- Test thoroughly

#### [INCOMPATIBLE] - Won't Work
- Usually flight abilities on non-flying bosses
- System prevents these combinations

### Common Compatibility Issues

#### Model Type Mismatch
**Issue**: Human abilities on beast models (or vice versa)
**Result**: Animations may look odd but abilities work
**Solution**: Test and decide if it's acceptable

#### Size Differences
**Issue**: Giant boss using small creature abilities
**Result**: Effects may scale strangely
**Solution**: Adjust expectations or choose different abilities

#### Flight Requirements
**Issue**: Flying abilities on grounded bosses
**Result**: Won't work - system blocks these
**Solution**: Choose non-flight alternatives

## Building Your Boss

### Design Philosophy

Think about the combat experience you want to create:

#### The Aggressive Rusher
```bash
# Fast movement and relentless attacks
.bb ability-slot "Berserker" "Alpha" 0 true "Quick bite combo"
.bb ability-slot "Berserker" "Jade" 2 true "Dash forward"
.bb ability-slot "Berserker" "Goreswine" 3 true "Charge attack"
```

#### The Tactical Mage
```bash
# Ranged attacks with positioning tools
.bb ability-slot "Archmage" "Vincent" 0 true "Frost bolt"
.bb ability-slot "Archmage" "Christina" 2 true "Holy beam"
.bb ability-slot "Archmage" "Styx" 3 true "Teleport"
```

#### The Unpredictable Hybrid
```bash
# Mix of everything to keep players guessing
.bb ability-slot "Chaos Lord" "Alpha" 0 true "Melee combo"
.bb ability-slot "Chaos Lord" "Vincent" 2 true "Frost explosion"
.bb ability-slot "Chaos Lord" "Jade" 4 true "Crossbow barrage"
.bb ability-slot "Chaos Lord" "Solarus" 6 true "Divine shield"
```

### Testing Your Creation

1. **Start Simple**: Add one ability at a time
2. **Test Each Addition**: Use `.bb debug test` to spawn and fight
3. **Watch for Issues**: Note any visual problems or balance concerns
4. **Iterate**: Adjust based on what you observe

### Balancing Considerations

#### Cooldown Synergy
- Mix short and long cooldown abilities
- Ensure boss always has something to do
- Avoid all abilities being available at once

#### Damage Types
- Varied damage keeps fights interesting
- Physical + Magic prevents single resistance strategy
- Consider player defensive options

#### Movement Options
- Too much mobility = frustrating
- No mobility = too easy to kite
- Balance is key

## Advanced Strategies

### Phase-Based Abilities

You don't have to give a boss all abilities at once. Consider:

1. **Start with basics** (slots 0-3)
2. **Add more as players learn**
3. **Save ultimates for special events**

### Thematic Consistency

While you CAN mix any abilities, thematic consistency creates better experiences:

#### Fire Lord Example
- Vincent's frost → Change mental model to fire
- Azariel's solar abilities → Already fire-themed
- Gorecrusher's ground effects → Imagine as lava

#### Shadow Assassin Example
- Jade's mobility → Perfect for assassin
- Styx's executions → Thematically appropriate
- Matka's curses → Shadow magic fits

### Creating Signature Combos

Design ability combinations that work together:

#### The Setup → Payoff
```bash
# Stun from Errol → Big damage from Gorecrusher
.bb ability-slot "Combo Boss" "Errol" 2 true "Stone prison"
.bb ability-slot "Combo Boss" "Gorecrusher" 3 true "Whirlwind"
```

#### The Zone Control
```bash
# Area denial from multiple sources
.bb ability-slot "Zone Boss" "Vincent" 2 true "Frost field"
.bb ability-slot "Zone Boss" "Christina" 3 true "Holy ground"
.bb ability-slot "Zone Boss" "Azariel" 4 true "Solar flare"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "VBlood not found"
**Problem**: Name doesn't match exactly
**Solution**: 
- Use partial names: "alpha" instead of "Alpha the White Wolf"
- Use `.bb ability-list` to see exact names
- Names are case-insensitive

#### "Ability doesn't seem to work"
**Problem**: Visual or functional issues
**Solution**:
- Check compatibility warnings
- Try a different slot number
- Some abilities need specific conditions

#### "Boss is too easy/hard"
**Problem**: Ability combination is imbalanced
**Solution**:
- Review cooldowns and damage
- Consider removing/adding abilities
- Test with different group sizes

### Performance Considerations

Some ability combinations can impact server performance:

- **Heavy Particle Effects**: Multiple visual abilities
- **Numerous Projectiles**: Spam abilities
- **Complex Calculations**: Certain buff combinations

Test thoroughly and monitor server performance.
